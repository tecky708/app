Certainly! Here's a simple Java program for a classic game called "Hangman." In this game, the computer selects a random word, and the player has to guess it by suggesting letters one at a time. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Random;

public class HangmanGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Random random = new Random();

        String[] words = { "java", "programming", "hangman", "computer", "code", "gaming" };
        String wordToGuess = words[random.nextInt(words.length)];
        int maxAttempts = 6;
        int attempts = 0;
        boolean[] guessedLetters = new boolean[wordToGuess.length()];

        System.out.println("Welcome to Hangman!");
        System.out.println("Try to guess the word.");

        while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
            displayWordStatus(wordToGuess, guessedLetters);
            System.out.print("Enter a letter: ");
            char guess = scanner.next().charAt(0);

            if (isGuessCorrect(wordToGuess, guessedLetters, guess)) {
                System.out.println("Correct guess!");
            } else {
                attempts++;
                System.out.println("Incorrect guess. Attempts left: " + (maxAttempts - attempts));
            }

            if (isWordGuessed(guessedLetters)) {
                System.out.println("Congratulations! You guessed the word: " + wordToGuess);
                break;
            }
        }

        if (attempts == maxAttempts) {
            System.out.println("You ran out of attempts. The word was: " + wordToGuess);
        }

        scanner.close();
    }

    public static void displayWordStatus(String word, boolean[] guessedLetters) {
        System.out.print("Word: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            if (guessedLetters[i]) {
                System.out.print(word.charAt(i));
            } else {
                System.out.print("_");
            }
            System.out.print(" ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static boolean isGuessCorrect(String word, boolean[] guessedLetters, char guess) {
        boolean correctGuess = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            if (word.charAt(i) == guess) {
                guessedLetters[i] = true;
                correctGuess = true;
            }
        }
        return correctGuess;
    }

    public static boolean isWordGuessed(boolean[] guessedLetters) {
        for (boolean letterGuessed : guessedLetters) {
            if (!letterGuessed) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
